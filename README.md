# Docker registry HDFS driver

This is a
[docker-registry backend driver](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-registry/tree/master/depends/docker-registry-core)
for Hadoop's HDFS.

Note: This is currently alpha software.  It works but I haven't used it
in production for very long.  Feel free to try it and give it a shot.
